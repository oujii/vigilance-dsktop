# Vigilance Desktop - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Converting the mobile Vigilance security app to a desktop webapp with multi-window control functionality. The desktop version will serve as a control panel that can manage multiple display windows, with the ability to turn screens on/off for film/TV production use.

## Key Requirements Analysis

### From context/example.html (Desktop Reference)
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Left sidebar with Vigilance logo and navigation links
- **Main Content Area**: Dashboard with camera feeds in grid layout  
- **System Stats**: Active cameras (14/14), System Health (99.8%), Storage (85%)
- **User Status**: Online/Offline user indicators (Adam, Carl)
- **Camera Grid**: Multiple camera feeds with hover controls

### From context/digest.txt (Mobile Reference)
- **App Architecture**: Next.js 15 with App Router, Inter fonts, dark theme
- **Color Scheme**: Background `#101828`, Surface `#1D2939`, blue accents
- **Authentication Flow**: Not needed for this desktop web app
- **Camera Components**: Video feeds with controls, online/offline states

### From context/same-origin-control.md (Multi-Window Control)
- **BroadcastChannel API**: Real-time cross-window communication
- **Zustand Store**: State management with localStorage persistence
- **Control System**: Power on/off states, synchronized across windows
- **Route Structure**: `/control` for main panel, `/display/[id]` for screens

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Desktop Layout Foundation
**Goal**: Convert mobile layout to desktop with sidebar navigation

1. **Update Layout Structure**
   - Create desktop layout with sidebar navigation (based on example.html)
   - Update `app/layout.tsx` to use Inter font (matching mobile version)
   - Implement responsive grid system for camera feeds with the ability to choose what videos go where so you can build your own layout grid of videos of your choice.

2. **Desktop Dashboard Page**
   - Create new `app/dashboard/page.tsx` with sidebar + main content layout
   - Port system stats from mobile version (14/14 cameras, 99.8% health, 85% storage)
   - Convert bottom navigation to sidebar navigation
   - Implement camera grid (3-column desktop vs 1-column mobile)

3. **Styling Updates**
   - Keep existing color scheme (`#101828`, `#1D2939`)
   - Update component sizes for desktop (larger touch targets, more spacing)
   - Ensure camera feeds work with desktop hover states

### Phase 2: Multi-Window Control System
**Goal**: Implement BroadcastChannel-based cross-window synchronization

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install zustand
   ```

2. **Create Store System** (`lib/store.ts`)
   - Implement Zustand store with BroadcastChannel integration
   - State: `power: 'ON' | 'OFF'`, `selectedCamera: string | null`
   - Actions: `setPower()`, `setSelectedCamera()`
   - Auto-sync between windows using BroadcastChannel API

3. **Route Structure**
   - `/control` - Main control panel (current dashboard)
   - `/display/[id]` - Display windows (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - `/` - Redirect to control panel

4. **Display Windows**
   - Create `app/display/[id]/page.tsx` 
   - Full-screen camera view when powered on
   - Black screen with "System Off" when powered off
   - Subscribe to store state changes for instant updates

### Phase 3: Authentication & Control Integration
**Goal**: Integrate logout functionality with power control

1. **Enhanced Authentication**
   - Add logout button to desktop sidebar
   - Connect logout action to power-off functionality

2. **Power Control Logic**
   - Logout triggers `setPower('OFF')` 
   - All display windows immediately show black screen
   - Control panel remains accessible for re-activation
   - State persists across page refreshes

3. **Camera Control Features**
   - Select individual cameras from control panel
   - Display selected camera on `/display/[id]` windows
   - Maintain camera feed controls (record, alerts, etc.)

### Phase 4: Desktop-Specific Features
**Goal**: Add desktop enhancements while maintaining mobile compatibility

1. **Enhanced Camera Grid**
   - Hover controls for all cameras (from example.html reference)
   - Drag & drop to reorder cameras
   - Full-screen camera preview on click

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `Space` - Toggle power on/off
   - `1-9` - Select camera feeds
   - `Esc` - Return to control panel

3. **Multi-Monitor Optimization**
   - Window positioning helpers
   - Full-screen API integration
   - Display window identification

### Phase 5: Production Features
**Goal**: Film/TV production specific enhancements

1. **Scene Control**
   - Quick power states (instant black screen)
   - Preset camera configurations
   - Silent operation (no notification sounds)

2. **Reliability Features**
   - Offline functionality (static export compatibility)
   - Manual refresh fallback
   - Error handling for failed BroadcastChannel communication

## File Structure Changes

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ control/page.tsx          # Main control panel (desktop dashboard)
â”œâ”€â”€ display/[id]/page.tsx     # Display windows (full-screen feeds)
â”œâ”€â”€ login/page.tsx           # Existing login (minor updates)
â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx               # Update for desktop layout
â””â”€â”€ page.tsx                 # Redirect to /control

lib/
â””â”€â”€ store.ts                 # Zustand + BroadcastChannel store

components/
â”œâ”€â”€ Sidebar.tsx              # Desktop navigation sidebar
â”œâ”€â”€ ControlPanel.tsx         # Main control interface
â”œâ”€â”€ DisplayWindow.tsx        # Full-screen display component
â”œâ”€â”€ CameraFeed.tsx          # Existing (minor updates for desktop)
â””â”€â”€ CameraGrid.tsx          # Desktop camera grid layout
```

## Technical Specifications

### State Management
- **Zustand** for global state with BroadcastChannel sync
- **LocalStorage** persistence for reliability
- **Real-time updates** within ~50ms across windows

### Responsive Design  
- **Desktop-first** approach with mobile fallback
